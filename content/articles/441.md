Many web applications rely on the upload of files from client to server via a POST request. The content-type of this request is generally multipart/form-data. When developing the server-side of such application, being able to quickly test the upload feature can greatly increase productivity. So, I designed this simple web application that can POST a file to any URL.

The application is built using Vue.js with the Vuetify plugin and uses Axios to send the HTTP requests. Its source code is available on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/moreillon_k8s_home/file-poster). The application can be deployed as a Docker container, for which the image is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/moreillon/file-poster).
