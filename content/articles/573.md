The other day, I found myself putting on some weight. This rather surprised me as I thought I was having a healthy diet and exercised almost daily. To identify the root of the problem, I decided to start measuring my calorie intake as well as the macronutrients that constitute said intake.

To achieve this, I built a simple web application using the MEVN stack. The application serves two purposes:

* Store information about the various food I eat
* Compute the total calorie count and macronutrients constitution of a given list of food

Food database
-------------

In order to compute a calorie count or macronutrient constitution of a meal, one must first know those values for each individual piece of food in it. This information is stored in a MongoDB collection, managed by its own model, controllers, routes and view.

Meal plans
----------

With a database for foods available, one can compose meal plans and compute their nutrition data easily. Those meals plans basically consist of a list of foods with a title and date for future reference. Those are stored in their own MongoDB collection and also benefit from their own controllers and view.
