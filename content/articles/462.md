Compared to other countries, Japan did not enforce a strict lockdown on its population during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, most bars and restaurants continued their operations as usual. However, in order to prevent the spread of the virus as much as possible, the staff of my local pub printed out signs asking customers to not leave their table without wearing a mask.

As they didn't have anything to hold the signs on the table, I offered to use my 3D printer to solve the problem.

Thus, I designed this sign holder and printed over 40 copies of it.
