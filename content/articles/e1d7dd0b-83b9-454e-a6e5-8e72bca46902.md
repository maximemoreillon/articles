[ChartMuseum](https://chartmuseum.com/) is an open-source Helm chart repository server which can be used as a self-hosted alternative to [Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io/). Although it originally consists of only a server-side application to be interacted with via a REST API, its official UI, [ChartMuseumUI](https://github.com/chartmuseum/ui), can be deployed to interact with ChartMuseum graphically.

Unfortunately, ChartMuseumUI seems to be broken and the GitHub repository has been inactive for years now. Thus, I decided to make my own GUI for ChartMuseum.

Deploying the application can be achieved using Docer:

```
docker run \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e PUBLIC_CHARTMUSEUM_URL=<URL OF CHARTMUSEUM> \
  moreillon/chartmuseum-gui
```

This GUI has been built using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and the [Svelte Material UI](https://sveltematerialui.com/) components. its source-code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/maximemoreillon/chartmuseum-gui).
