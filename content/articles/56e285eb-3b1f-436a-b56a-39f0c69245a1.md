Maintaining good habits can sometimes be hard. Recently, I've been looking at the way contributions are displayed on GitHub: a grid with a cell for each day, turning green if contributions have been made on that date.

I realized that it motivated me to write code everyday, just to keep that grid as green as possible. So, I decided to create an app that provides a similar kind of motivation but for habits other than coding daily.

With this app, users can register habits they would like to maintain, such as doing 50 push-ups or reading a book. Each habit to maintain becomes a row of a grid, with a cell for each day of the month. Every time the habit is achieved for the day, the corresponding cell is pressed and turns red. This allows to see how well one is doing with those habits within a month at a glance and hopefully provides a boost in motivation.

The app has been built using Firebase with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) for its GUI. UI components have been provided by the [Svelte Material UI library](https://sveltematerialui.com/). Its source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/maximemoreillon/habit-tracker-gui).
