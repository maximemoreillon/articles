I recenly got myself an USB ype C dock for my laptop. This accessory quite convenient as it allows me to connect my laptop to power, my external monitor and USB peripherals with just one cable.

The dock itself works fine but because of the way its ports are laid out, it makes a mess of wires on my desk. To solve the issue, I decided to mount the USB dock on the back of my laptop stand.

In order to do so, I designed a few parts which I then 3D printed and then assembled with a piece of aliminium to create holder for the dock. This time, the part design was done with FreeCad, which I am transitioning to from Fusion350.

The parts were printed on my QIDI Tech 1 using black PLA.
