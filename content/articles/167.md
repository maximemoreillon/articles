The company behind my credit card provides a web interface which includes a log of the transactions that have been made. The objective of this project is to automatically retrieve this log everyday and store its data in a database so as to display it on a custom dashboard.

The main challenge of this project is the access to the log, which requires user authentication. Luckily, the security of the web interface is quite loose and consists only of a username-password combo. Thanks to this, Puppeteer can be used to log into the web interface and retrieve the log data without needing human interaction.

The scraping results are sent via Rest API call to my finance management app.
