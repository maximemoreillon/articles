As a graph database Neo4j is a great choice to manage highly relational data. On the other side, a great number of applications feature at least some form of user management system. With Neo4j, those users can be store as nodes and connected to other items via relationships. A typical example would be a blog, where both articles and users are individual nodes while authorships are represented by a relationship.

When dealing with a large number of users, it can become convenient to arrange those in groups. Here, groups too can be represented as nodes and the membership of a user by a relationship. However, building group management logic from scratch for every application would be tedious.

This microservice, named Group manager, proposes a solution to this problem by offering just the generic logic to handle groups and their relationships, making it easy to integrate in a microservice architecture, alongside other services managing Neo4j records.

This service takes advantage from the Neo4j database used by the user management service and adds a "Group" node type. Members can be added to a group by creating a BELONGS\_TO relationship between a user and the desired group. Similarly, a user can be made administrator of a group using an ADMINISTRATED\_BY relationship.

The group nodes and their relationships are managed by a back-end built using Node.js and express, which exposes a REST API to perform the appropriate operations.

To make group management easier, I developed a companion GUI using Vue.js. The GUI allows the creation and deletion of groups, edition of their details as well as adding and removing members or administrators to them.
