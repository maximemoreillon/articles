By default Docker refuses to push/pull from registries that are not served using HTTPS.

To enable Docker to push to registries served over HTTP, the address of the registry must be appended to the `insecure-registries` Array of the `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file. If the file does not exist, it must be created.

Here is an example:

```
{
  "insecure-registries" : ["IP:PORT"]
}
```

Docker must be restarted after changes to `/etc/docker/daemon.json` have been done:

```
sudo systemctl restart docker
```
