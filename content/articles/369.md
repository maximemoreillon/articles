In Javascript, a function can be defined as so:

```
var myFunction = function(){
  console.log('hello world')
}
```

This function can be called using brackets as so:

```
myFunction()
```

which would print `hello world`in the console.

Sometimes, naming a function might not be necessary, for example if the function is just called once within the code. In such case, the function can be made self-executing using wrapping brackets:

```
(function(){
  console.log('hello world')
})()
```
