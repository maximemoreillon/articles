LINE, the most popular messaging app in Japan, provides an API to build bots. Those bots can react to receive messages or send their own.

I decided to use this API to build a simple notification microservice. Whenever a message is posted on its /notify endpoint, the message gets sent to my smartphone.

In previous versions of the service, I also experimented with the processing of messages sent to the service. For instance, checking my apartment's electricity consumption.

However, to stay in line with the interest of other potential users of the application, I decided to focus only on the notification function of this application.
