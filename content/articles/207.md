C is widely considered to be a difficult programming language. Here are various code snippets to help make some sense of it.

Hello world
-----------

Here is the traditional Hello World in C:

```
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
   // printf() displays the string inside quotation
   printf("Hello, World!");
   return 0;
}
```

Typedef
-------

Is used to define a new type.

for example:

```
typedef unsigned int natural;
```

defines natural as unsigned int

then a natural variable can be declared as:

```
natural a = 2;
```

struct
------

```
struct Rectangle {
  int width;
  int height;
};
```

creates a new type called struct Rectangle

```
struct  Rectangle myRectangle;
```

declares a struct Rectangle called myRectangle

Properties accessed as so:

```
myRectangle.width = 10;
```

struct Rectangle is annoying to type so we can use a typedef:

```
typedef struct Rectangle Rectangle;
```

a shortcut is:

```
typedef struct Rectangle {
  int width;
  int height;
} Rectangle;
```
