[In a previous article](https://articles.maximemoreillon.com/articles/390) I showcased a simple home server built around an Odroid XU4, which I dismantled after migrating to a full-size desktop computer. However, having the Odroid laying around unused was a bit of a waste and I recently started needing a secondary file server to store data backups. So I decided to build a new server with the single board computer.

The core hardware remained similar to the original server: the Odroid itself, a hard disk connected via USB to SATA converter and a power supply. However, this time I decided to package the components in a compact PC case.

Because the XU4 does not have a typical ATX (mini, micro or anything) form factor, mounting it in the case required a special frame which I designed in FreeCad and 3D printed.

As a result, the server works similarly to its previous version but in a more robust enclosure.
