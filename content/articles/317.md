The ESP32 supports ov2640 cameras, which makes it an ideal platform for a DIY IP camera. For this purpose, I wrote a customized firmware for the ESP32 which provides the following features:

* Streaming from the camera
* Getting the latest frame from the camera
* Firmware update by uploading new binary files

This firmware is written for [AI Thinker](https://www.ai-thinker.com/) boards but could easily be adapted to other boards by modifying the GPIO assignment. [Here](https://github.com/maximemoreillon/esp32_camera_web_server) is a link to its GitHub repo.
