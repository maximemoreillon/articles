This article is based on [this publiation](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-a-beautiful-tiny-npm-package-and-publish-it-2881d4307f78/).

To publish to npm, being logged in is required:

```
npm login
```

The package to be published must be contained in its own directory, which must include a `package.json` file

The `package.json` file must contain at least the following information:

```
{
  "name": "@USERNAME/MODULE_NAME",
  "version": "0.0.1"
  "main": "FILE.js",
}
```

where `USERNAME` is the username of registered npmjs.com account, `MODULE_NAME` is the name of the module to publish and `FILE.js` the main file of the module.

Additionally, the version must be set to the X.Y.Z format

```
npm publish --access=public
```

The content of node\_modules is automatically ignored so dependencies can be added easily using

```
npm install --save DEPENDENCY_NAME
```
