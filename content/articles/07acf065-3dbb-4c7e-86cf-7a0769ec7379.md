**Note**: an option to add the Vue-router has now been integrated in Vite.

Previously, when creating a Vue project using the Vue CLI, the Vue Router could be installed easily by running vue add router. However, with Vue 3 and Vite, the router is installed manually. This can be done with NPM:

```
npm install vue-router@4
```

Once installed, the configuration of the router can be done by creating a dedicated .js file in the src directory of the app. To mimic the structure of Vue 2 projects, the router config file is named index.js, to be created in a folder called router, sub-folder of src. A basic content would look as follows:

```
import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from "vue-router";

import Home from '@/views/Home.vue'

const routes = [
    { path: '/', component: Home },
]

const router = createRouter({
    history: createWebHistory(),
    routes, 
})

export default router
```

Here, views are described in their .vue files in the views folder.

The router can then be added to the Vue application by editing the main.js file to look as follows:

```
// Components
import App from './App.vue'
import router from './router'

// Composables
import { createApp } from 'vue'

// Plugins
import { registerPlugins } from '@/plugins'

const app = createApp(App)

registerPlugins(app)

app
  .use(router)
  .mount('#app')
```

With this done, the Vue Router should now be ready to use in the application
