RFID tags come in various forms and sizes, from standard plastic cards to chips that can be implanted in one's hand. I got particularly interested in RFID rings, which can be purchased online for less than USD 20$. Those are based on EM4305 chips, which require a compatible reader. Thus, I designed an IoT EM4305 reader that can exchange data over MQTT with other devices.

Hardware
--------

The reader is built around an ESP8266 Wifi microcontroller and an unnamed EM4305 reader module.

User feedback is provided using an OLED display and a Piezzo buzzer. Those component are laid out according to this schematic:

A PCB has been design based on the schematic. Its layout is as follows:

More details about the hardware can be found on [OSHWLab](https://oshwlab.com/m.moreillon/iot-em4305-reader).

Software
--------

The device runs an Arduino sketch which handles the EM4305 chip and communicates with other IoT devices via MQTT. The sketch can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/maximemoreillon/ring_reader_oled).
