[ITEAD](https://www.itead.cc/)'s [SONOFF](https://sonoff.itead.cc/en/)s are Wi-Fi enabled relays that can be used to turn applicances on and off remotely.

The firmware they come with did not suit my needs so I wrote and flashed my own. This can be achieved easily since the SONOFFS are built around an ESP8266 chip, which can be programmed with the Arduino IDE.

Here is a list of functions that the custom firmware features:

* MQTT support with JSON payloads
* REST API
* Control through web interface
* Update through web interface
* Update using Arduino OTA
