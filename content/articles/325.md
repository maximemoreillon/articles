Here are the steps to prepare a brand new hard drive and install a file system on it.

Setting up partitions
---------------------

Partitions can be managed using parted:

```
sudo parted
```

### Creating a partition table

A partition table stores information about the partitions of the drive. It can be created using:

```
mklabel
```

GPT is the current standard for label types.

```
New disk label type? gpt
```

### Creating a partition

The command mkpart can be used to create partitions on the disk

```
mkpart
```

Note that the partition name is not the label of the partition's file system

```
Partition name?  []? primary
```

Among the various existing file systems, ext4 is the most convenient for Linux

```
File system type?  [ext2]? ext4
```

Define the size of the partition

```
Start? 2048s                                                              
End? 100%
```

Creating a file system in a partition
-------------------------------------

Replace MY\_LABEL by the label to be used for the file system

```
mkfs.ext4 -L MY_LABEL /dev/sda1
```
