Foreign models are quite in demand in Japan and as such it is not uncommon for foreigners living there to have a side activity in the modeling industry. I had the chance to meet the manager a [AZS entertainment](https://azs-group.jp/) and was told that the agency was currently recruiting. So, since I am always looking for new life experiences, I decided to join.

AZS entertainment was kind enough to prepare a [webpage for my profile on their website](https://azs-group.jp/manage_post/990). However, since I own the maximemoreillon.com domain, I decided that I could also host my own profile web page here. Thus, I made a simple page with some of my pictures, body measurements and links, deployed at [modeling.maximemoreillon.com](http://modeling.maximemoreillon.com).

The webpage is built fairly simply, using vanilla HTML CSS and a tiny amount of JavaScript. Here, I relied heavily on CSS grid to make layouting more convenient. its source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/maximemoreillon/modeling-profile).
