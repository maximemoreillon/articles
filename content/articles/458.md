With the COVID-19 pandemic, many of us cannot participate in family gatherings or other similar events in person. Instead, some opt for video-call applications like zoom, but then get constrained to the field of view of camera of the device used for the call.

In order to look around more freely, I modified this off the shelf pan-tilt platform so as to be controlled by MQTT from anywhere in the world.

The original RF receiver of the YT260 has been replaced by a Wemos D1 Mini ESP8266 breakout board.
