The thermal insulation of my apartment not being the best, I decided to buy an electric heater in order not to freeze during cold winter nights. However, the one I got was probably too powerful for my needs and letting it run for too long would heat up my place too much. Thus, I added a wifi enabled controller to it so its operations are controlled by my home automation system.

The controller consists of a relay connected to an ESP8266 which repsonds to MQTT commands. Moreover, a button is also added to allow for manual operations. The status of the heater is displayed using an LED. The firmware running on the ESP8266 is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/maximemoreillon/heater)

The heater itself is pretty silent. However, the sound of an electromechanical relay might get annoying during the night so I chose to use an SSR-25DA solid state relay to turn the heater on and off.

Please note that handling mains electricity is extremely dangerous. Not only is there a high risk of electrocution, poorly designed devices can also easily catch fire due to the power involved. Attempt projects like this at your own risk.

The electronics are installed in a 3D printed enclosure attached to the back of the heater. Here is a list of the parts involved:

* Wemos D1 mini
* SSR-25DA Solid state relay
* AC-DC power supply
* LED + resistor
* Push button
