There are multiple tools available for API testing, Postman and Insomnia being probably the most popular. However, those are desktop applications that need to be installed. I wanted a solution that I can use in the browser so I made a simple web application to achieve basic API testing functions.

This application can send GET, POST, DELETE, PUT and PATCH HPP requests and allows the user to add headers or a JSON body to the request.

The application is built using Vue.js with the Vuetify plugin and relies on Axios to perform the HTTP requests.

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/maximemoreillon/request_maker). Also, the application can be deployed as a Docker container, for which the image is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/moreillon/request-maker).
