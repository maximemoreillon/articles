This article presents how to combine two independent and unrelated git repositories.

First, clone the first repository locally and cd into it.

```
git clone URL_TO_REMOTE_1
```

Create a branch off the first remote

```
git checkout -b master-2
```

In order to merge a completely independent repository into the current one, **delete** the content of the folder apart from the .git folder. Once done, commit the changes:

```
git commit -m 'prepared for combining repositories'
```

Add the remote of the second repository

```
git remote add remote-2 URL_TO_REPOSITORY_2
```

Its content can be pulled into the current branch:

```
git pull remote-2 master --allow-unrelated-histories
```

The content of remote-2 will now be part of the git tree of the original remote, under a branch called master-2.

Master-2 can be merged into master one to finish the combination of the repositories.
