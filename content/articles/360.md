By default, Minikube will not allow the usage of insecure docker registries. To change this setting, Minikube can be started as so:

Argument --insecure registry can be used

```
minikube start --insecure-registry="http://192.168.1.2:5000"
```

Here, replace http://192.168.1.2 with the URL of the registry

For bare-metal (requires sudo):

```
sudo minikube start --insecure-registry="http://192.168.1.2:5000" --vm-driver=none
```

Note: if Minikube had already been started without the insecure-registry option, it must be stopped and recreated:

```
minikube stop
minikube delete
```
