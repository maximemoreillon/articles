Let's imagine that we have a python class as follows (Python 3):

```
class MyClass:
	def init(self):
	# Code of the class constructor...
	print("Instance of MyClass created")
```

A child class of MyClass can be created as such:

```
class MyChildClass(MyClass):
	def init(self):
	    super().init__() # calls constructor of MyClass
	    print("Instance of MyChildClass created")
```

By creating an instance of MyChildClass, `Instance of MyClass created` and `Instance of MyChildClass created` should be printed in the console.
