I have been unlocking my door with this [RFID ring and its dedicated IoT RFID reader](https://articles.maximemoreillon.com/articles/03878fe3-1eca-4f22-9521-0589ba076930) for several years now. Despite working without any issues, this system required me to wear a ring that I could potentially lose. So, instead of using the ring as a key, I decided to use the finger that I would put it on and thus designed an IoT fingerprint reader.

The reader is made of an AS608 fingerprint reader module driven by an ESP32. Additionally, an OLED display and buzzer are provided for user feedback. Those components are connected as follows:

The ESP32 runs a custom firmware for which the source-code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/maximemoreillon/iot_fingerprint_reader).
