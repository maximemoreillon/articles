Here are a few commands to manage docker images and containers

Images
------

List all images:

```
docker image ls -a
```

Delete an image:

```
docker image rm IMAGE_NAME
```

Containers
----------

Run a container:

```
docker run IMAGE_NAME
```

Here, the container will run in the foreground with a randomly assigned name

Run a container in the background:

```
docker run -d IMAGE_NAME
```

Run a container and give it a certain name:

```
docker run -n CONTAINER_NAME IMAGE_NAME
```

Stop a container (gracefully):

```
docker stop CONTAINER_NAME
```

Kill a container (ungraceful stop):

```
docker kill CONTAINER_NAME
```

List all containers, including those that are stopped:

```
docker container ls -a
```

Delete a container:

```
docker container rm CONTAINER_NAME
```

or

```
docker rm CONTAINER_NAME
```
