The SONOFF S20 is a cheap Wifi smart socket that enables the remote control of appliances for less than USD 10. Although the hardware is more than decent, its usage requires a proprietary app which most likely involves a third party server between the user and the device. Since the socket uses an ESP8266 at its core, I decided to write my own firmware for it.

I designed the firmware so as to control the socket via MQTT messages. I also added a web server that serves a simple UI for configuration and firmware updates. Initially, the firmware was flashed using the exposed UART connector inside the SONOFF S20.
