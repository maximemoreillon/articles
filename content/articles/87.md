Many companies rely on spreadsheets to keep track of their fixed assets. However, spreadsheets are commonly designed to be edited manually, which makes automation difficult.

The application presented in this article is a fixed asset management system based on a MongoDB database, and provides a REST API which makes it possible for other applications or devices to perform CRUD operations on the data, hence greatly improving the automation potential.

The application uses the MEVN ( MongoDB, Express, Vue.js, Node.js ) stack and thus offers a browser-based GUI.

To facilitate inventory, QR codes are stuck to the assets, which trigger an update of the database when scanned by a smartphone.

Moreover, the update can also contain the smartphone's GPS data so as to automatically register the location of the asset.

In the future, RFID tags could be added to the assets so as to trigger a database update when read.
