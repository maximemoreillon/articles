OpenProject is an awesome project management application that can be installed on one's own server. This makes it ideal for users who want to keep control over their data. However, at the time of writing this article, OpenProject does not yet provide installation methods for Kubernetes so I decided to write my own manifest files.

The manifests can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/maximemoreillon/openproject_kubernetes_manifests).
