      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, a friend of mine was organizing an event to promote eco-friendly behaviors. She wanted someone to talk about our relationship with energy and asked me to give a presentation on the topic, which I agreed to. I wanted the presentation to be entertaining so I designed a set of hardware demonstrations aimed at explaining physical concepts related to energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core idea was to show how energy is not created but transformed from one form to another. Consequently, if one wants to use electricity to power a light bulb, this electricity must be transform from mechanical or chemical energy, for example. Additionally, the light bulb transforms electrical energy into light, but also heat, which is an undesirable byproduct of the transformation. This brings the concept of efficiency, which is to be maximized as much as possible so as to reduce energy &amp;ldquo;waste&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
