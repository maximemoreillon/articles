      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been unlocking my door with this &lt;a href=&#34;https://articles.maximemoreillon.com/articles/03878fe3-1eca-4f22-9521-0589ba076930&#34;&gt;RFID ring and its dedicated IoT RFID reader&lt;/a&gt; for several years now. Despite working without any issues, this system required me to wear a ring that I could potentially lose. So, instead of using the ring as a key, I decided to use the finger that I would put it on and thus designed an IoT fingerprint reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://img.maximemoreillon.com/images/64a496783581c50013b5a9f9&#34; alt=&#34;Article image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reader is made of an AS608 fingerprint reader module driven by an ESP32. Additionally, an OLED display and buzzer are provided for user feedback. Those components are connected as follows:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a few projects involving digital twins. At its core, a digital twin is simply a digital representation, oftentimes in 3D, of a physical system. Such representation commonly provides information about the system as well as ways of interactions. On the physical system, this is can be accomplished with IoT devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having to build a dedicated application for each digital twin would be tedious so I designed a simple framework to make the process more convenient. The framework uses Three.js for the 3D representation of the system and MQTT to interact with its IoT devices, which led to the name MQTThree.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although a wide variety of sensing devices can be envisioned for home automation systems, motion and temperature sensors are among the most widespread. This is mostly due to their low cost and simplicity of use. In order to equip multiple rooms of my apartment with such sensors, I designed a simple IoT sensing module that can easily be produced in any quantity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The module is designed around an Wemos D1 mini (ESP8266 module) which interfaces with a HC-SR501 PIR motion sensor and Dallas DS18B20 temperature sensor. Additionally, since the Wemos still had a lot of available pins available, I added a photoresistor to measure illuminance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;RFID tags come in various forms and sizes, from standard plastic cards to chips that can be implanted in one&amp;rsquo;s hand. I got particularly interested in RFID rings, which can be purchased online for less than USD 20$. Those are based on EM4305 chips, which require a compatible reader. Thus, I designed an IoT EM4305 reader that can exchange data over MQTT with other devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hardware&#34;&gt;Hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reader is built around an ESP8266 Wifi microcontroller and an unnamed EM4305 reader module.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Smart lights are usually some of the first appliances to be added to a smart home. Although those can nowadays be purchased easily from various brands, I wanted to have my own hardware so as to integrate it better with other devices and software. Thus, I decided to an IoT LED controller that I can use in various projects where lighting has to be controlled via network protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://img.maximemoreillon.com/images/6240057135a52f5ea69e899b&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hardware&#34;&gt;Hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controller is built around an ESP8266 microcontroller (Wemos D1 mini) and N-Channel MOSFETS. The latter switch the 12V line of LED strips or COBs according to the microcontroller. Here, up to 4 channels of LEDs can be controlled by a single controller.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I have written firmwares for various IoT devices such as lights, locks or heaters. Those firmwares would generally handle a common set of basic functions like managing wifi connection, serving a configuration web interface over HTTP or exchange MQTT messages. However, having to implement and maintain those functions for each individual firmware quickly became tedious work. Consequently, I decided to write a library to handle all those basic functions. This library is used as a base for IoT device firmwares, on top of which device-specific logic can easily be added.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;connect-to-the-devices-wifi-access-point&#34;&gt;Connect to the device&amp;rsquo;s WiFi access point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When used for the first time, the device will have no knowledge of what WiFi to connect to. Consequently, the smart outlet will generate its own, prefixed with the name &lt;em&gt;socket.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://img.maximemoreillon.com/images/61cab9b835a52f0b519e337d&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecting to the access point should automatically open a configuration page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wifi-configuration&#34;&gt;WiFi configuration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once connected to the wifi, the following page should open. On this page, the WiFi settings and MQTT credentials can be set.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of a previous project, I installed an &lt;a href=&#34;https://articles.maximemoreillon.com/articles/237&#34;&gt;IoT lock&lt;/a&gt; on my front door, which allowed me to control it using my smartphone. However, having to take out my smartphone every time I want to unlock the door quickly becomes annoying. To improve on the situation, I installed an RFID reader on the lock, which I used in combination with an &lt;a href=&#34;https://articles.maximemoreillon.com/articles/523&#34;&gt;RFID ring which now serves as my key&lt;/a&gt;. To follow up on this trend of finding new ways to unlock my door, I decided to explore face recognition technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The SONOFF S20 is a cheap Wifi smart socket that enables the remote control of appliances for less than USD 10. Although the hardware is more than decent, its usage requires a proprietary app which most likely involves a third party server between the user and the device. Since the socket uses an ESP8266 at its core, I decided to write my own firmware for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I designed the firmware so as to control the socket via MQTT messages. I also added a web server that serves a simple UI for configuration and firmware updates. Initially, the firmware was flashed using the exposed UART connector inside the SONOFF S20.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wifi controlled smart light bulbs can now be purchased from less than USD 10. However, those can often only be used by a specific application provided by the vendor and can involve exchanging data with a third party server. I wanted a solution to use my own software while benefiting from the cheap hardware so I replaced the wifi module of a a cheap Wifi light bulb my own electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>General purpose IoT button</title>
      <link>https://articles.maximemoreillon.com/articles/483/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I have built multiple IoT devices ranging from AC controllers to ceiling lights. Usually, I would control those devices using my smartphone or computer but sometimes a physical button can be more convenient. Thus, I designed this simple IoT button which publishes MQTT messages when pressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://img.maximemoreillon.com/images/6148102f5d171a137f416ccb&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, the button integrates my ESP12-F base PCB, which features a switch connected to GPIO0 used to put the ESP8266 in programming mode. After a successful boot, the GPIO0 can be used freely so I wrote a simple firmware that publishes an MQTT message when the pin gets pulled LOW.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although probably in the decline, infrared is a common way to remotely control household appliances such as air conditioners or TVs. Being able to turn on an AC unit without leaving the sofa is definitely comfortable, but sometimes it would be even better to be able to do it before even getting home. In order to control those various appliances, I designed a simple WiFi controlled IR emitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device consists of an ESP8266, an IR LED and IR receiver. The IR receiver is used to record IR signals from the original remote controller of the appliances. Those signals are stored in the ESP8266, which can then replay those using the IR LED.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am not much of a cook so salads are usually one of my favorite options for a healthy meal. So, just like for everything else, I started wondering if I could make my own. However, I don&amp;rsquo;t have access to a garden so I started looking into solutions to grow vegetables indoors. I settled for hydroponics, which seemed to provide a good balance between yield and operational hassle. Specifically, I went for a Deep Water Culture type of hydroponic system as it is usually considered easy for beginners to setup.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Global warming and the COVID-19 pandemic are some the many challenges humanity is having to face. However, I somehow decided that the problem I was going to solve is having to take my keys out of my pocket whenever I lock or unlock my front door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of a literal key, I would ideally have some form of access token that stays within hands reach and can unlock my door. In fact, I figured that it could actually be on my hand and thus went shopping for an RFID ring on AliExpress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the COVID-19 pandemic, many of us cannot participate in family gatherings or other similar events in person. Instead, some opt for video-call applications like zoom, but then get constrained to the field of view of camera of the device used for the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to look around more freely, I modified this off the shelf pan-tilt platform so as to be controlled by MQTT from anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Energy transformation demonstration</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, a friend of mine was organizing an event to promote eco-friendly behaviors. She wanted someone to talk about our relationship with energy and asked me to give a presentation on the topic, which I agreed to. I wanted the presentation to be entertaining so I designed a set of hardware demonstrations aimed at explaining physical concepts related to energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core idea was to show how energy is not created but transformed from one form to another. Consequently, if one wants to use electricity to power a light bulb, this electricity must be transform from mechanical or chemical energy, for example. Additionally, the light bulb transforms electrical energy into light, but also heat, which is an undesirable byproduct of the transformation. This brings the concept of efficiency, which is to be maximized as much as possible so as to reduce energy &amp;ldquo;waste&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A company I worked for had a coffee machine for which employees could purchase coffee. However, the payment was done by putting coins in a jar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only did this present the obvious risk of theft, this system was also impractical for people not carrying spare change at all time. I decided to solve this issue by designing this cashless payment system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the companies I used to work for had a serious bathroom issue: My floor had only three toilet stalls for about 200 employees. There were countless times when I would walk all the way to the bathroom only to find all stalls occupied. I built this simple system to quickly identify whether one or more stall were. It consists of an IoT sensor installed on the bathroom stalls&amp;rsquo; door and an indicator placed somewhere easily visible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted my home automation system to detect when I arrive home so as to unlock my door automatically or let me know if I leave the apartment without turning the A/C off. I figured my smartphone could be used to achieve this since it is equipped with a vast array of sensors and connectivity options. For example, I could use an app like OwnTracks which would send an MQTT message once I enter a certain perimeter around my apartment. However, constantly monitoring one&amp;rsquo;s GPS location is wasteful in terms of battery life. Another option would be to ping my phone&amp;rsquo;s IP address to check if it is connected to the WiFi, but smartphones can sometimes take a while to connect. So, I decided to use BLE advertising, which does not use too much battery while still remaining constantly active.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Smartwatches can be rather expensive and tend to be known for their poor battery life. On the other hand, Xiaomi&amp;rsquo;s Mi band 2 is cheap and its battery lasts for up to 20 days. However, the Mi band 2 is mainly limited to fitness tracking functions, at least without the appropriate apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of this project was to take advantage of the Mi Band 2&amp;rsquo;s connection with a smartphone to control IoT devices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project consists of an HC-SR501 PIR motion sensor and a DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor connected to a Wemos D1 mini, an ESP8266 breakout board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://img.maximemoreillon.com/images/5e785a235e7fee47b76e5746&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MQTT messages are published whenever motion is detected, which can be used for room presence estimation. On the other hand, humidity and temperature are measured and published periodically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parts list is pretty straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Few would argue that having lights turned on in a room without occupant is a waste of electricity. Ideally, lights and other appliances like air conditioners would only be turned on when someone is around. This project is a NodeJS application that gathers data about the occupancy of an apartment and manages appliances accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I modified all the lights, air conditioners and heaters of my apartment so as to control them via MQTT. In the process, I also deployed multiple sensors among which are PIR motion sensors. This node app subscribes to the MQTT topics of all motion sensors and determines in which room the user is based on which sensor was triggered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>IoT air conditioner controller</title>
      <link>https://articles.maximemoreillon.com/articles/185/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Air conditioners consume a fair amount of electricity. As such, forgetting to turn one off before leaving one&amp;rsquo;s home can result in an expensive electricity bill. This is a Wi-Fi enabled controller for air conditioners, which can turn the unit on or off according to MQTT messages. It is built around an Wemos D1 mini and interfaces with the AC using an IR LED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wemos D1 mini drives the infrared LED so as to send signals identical to that of the original remote controller of the AC. Those signals must first be recorded, which can be done with an IR receiver connected to an Arduino running &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.analysir.com/blog/2014/03/19/air-conditioners-problems-recording-long-infrared-remote-control-signals-arduino/&#34;&gt;this sketch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The thermal insulation of my apartment not being the best, I decided to buy an electric heater in order not to freeze during cold winter nights. However, the one I got was probably too powerful for my needs and letting it run for too long would heat up my place too much. Thus, I added a wifi enabled controller to it so its operations are controlled by my home automation system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>IoT lock</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever left your apartment and couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember if you locked your front door or not? Sadly, if it is unlocked, there is not much you can do about it until you get back home. This system is an attempt to solve the problem. Simply put, it consists of attaching an actuator to the door&amp;rsquo;s original locking mechanism and control it via WiFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose an MG996R as an actuator for its sufficient torque and angle range (180 deg). Most of the parts for this project have been 3D printed and designed in Fusion 360. The STL files are available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2462482&#34;&gt;Thingiverse&lt;/a&gt;. The servo&amp;rsquo;s shaft and the door&amp;rsquo;s locking mechanism are connected with parts designed specially so as to have a 90 degree play between them. This allows the lock to be operated normally without having the servo interfering.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Light controller with PIR sensor</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is an IoT ceiling light controller which includes an HC-SR501 PIR motion sensor. It is built around a Wemos D1 mini (ESP8266 breakout board), which controls a homemade TRIAC breakout board. TRIACs provide the advantage of switching devices on and off silently, as opposed to a mechanical relay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://img.maximemoreillon.com/images/5e7859695e7feee2d46e5744&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system is powered from the same AC lines as the lights, thanks to an embedded AC-DC converter. This removes the need for an additional power supply.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Smart home control panel (SHCP)</title>
      <link>https://articles.maximemoreillon.com/articles/154/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.home-assistant.io/&#34;&gt;Home Assistant&lt;/a&gt; to control my home IoT devices for a while. Although it fulfills all my needs, I wanted to make my own system so as to get a fully customized smart home control panel and learn how to build such an application in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple way to build such an app would be to open the port corresponding to MQTT on my router and make an UI in JavaScript with an MQTT client-side library to communicate with the devices directly. However, for security reasons, I prefer to open only web-related ports to the public. Moreover, my MQTT traffic is currently unencrypted so it would not be wise to use it on a public network. Ideally, I would like to keep all MQTT communication internally with the MQTT port closed on my router, communicating via encrypted TCP traffic. For this purpose, I built a &lt;a href=&#34;https://nodejs.org/&#34;&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt; app that interacts with the outside world through HTTPS and then communicates with IoT devices internally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Solar power setup</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got my hands on a 600W 12V inverter so I decided to experiment with generating my own electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inverter converts 12V DC power into 100V AC electricity which can be used for household appliances. Here, the 12V DC power is supplied by a 45Ah lead-acid battery, which would allow the inverter to run at full power for slightly short of an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://img.maximemoreillon.com/images/62b91cd73bbcbae9ee77c094&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battery is charged by a 30W solar panel, through a 10A solar charge controller. Thus, with full sunlight, the battery would theoretically be charged in about 18 hours. I don&amp;rsquo;t intend to use the inverter on a daily basis so the slow rate of charge isn&amp;rsquo;t so much of a limitation. If needed, I could still add another solar panel in parallel in order to boost the charging current.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SONOFF Firmware</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.itead.cc/&#34;&gt;ITEAD&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://sonoff.itead.cc/en/&#34;&gt;SONOFF&lt;/a&gt;s are Wi-Fi enabled relays that can be used to turn applicances on and off remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firmware they come with did not suit my needs so I wrote and flashed my own. This can be achieved easily since the SONOFFS are built around an ESP8266 chip, which can be programmed with the Arduino IDE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of functions that the custom firmware features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MQTT support with JSON payloads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;REST API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control through web interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update through web interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update using Arduino OTA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>IoT ceiling lights</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After experimenting with various options to make my existing lights smarter, I decided that designing my own hardware would provide me with more customization options. The result are those ceiling lights, made out of an aluminum frame and COB LEDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, white COB LEDs provide most of luminance but the lights also feature RGB LED strips to add color to the lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LEDs are controlled by a custom PCB which embeds MOSFETs for each color channel, driven by an ESP8266. Here, PWM is used to provide a dimming feature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>IoT Current consumption monitoring system</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you don&amp;rsquo;t know how much power your air conditioner draws, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to leave it running without feeling too guilty. And then the electricity bill comes&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective of this project is to get an approximate measurement of how much electric power is being used in my apartment. Additionally, for the sake of safety, the measurement system should not require altering the electrical wiring currently in place. In other words, the measurement should be non-invasive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>IoT RFID reader</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;RFID is a convenient technology for access control and authentication. In this project, I connected an RC522 RFID reader to an ESP32 in order to use it for IoT applications. Additionally, to provide feedback to the user, the ESP32 is also connected to an SSD1306 OLED display and a buzzer. I chose an ESP32 over an ESP8266 simply because of the amount of GPIOs required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://img.maximemoreillon.com/images/5e786e6f6f2c2a9eb519cad6&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I intended to build multiple of those readers but it would take too much time to make them using protoboard. So, I designed a custom PCB using &lt;a href=&#34;https://easyeda.com/&#34;&gt;EasyEDA&lt;/a&gt; and had multiple copies manufactured by &lt;a href=&#34;https://jlcpcb.com/&#34;&gt;JLCPCB&lt;/a&gt;. A link to the complete EasyEDA project can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://easyeda.com/m.moreillon/iot_rfid_reader&#34;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>IoT scale</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Keeping track of one&amp;rsquo;s body weight usually involves manually writing down measurements on a spreadsheet or similar. To automate the process, I removed the electronics of a cheap scale, keeping only the load cells, and replaced it with my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I installed an HX711 load cell amplifier, Wemos D1 mini (ESP8266 breakout board) and SSD1306 OLED display. With this setup, the ESP8266 reads measurements from the load cells, converts it into the appropriate value in kilograms and uploads it using HTTP requests to an API of my choice via Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
