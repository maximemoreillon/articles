Those sensors generally broadcast individual measurements without saving any form of history locally. Consequently, if one would want to plot time-series graphs, the data would first need to be stored somewhere. This is the objective of the application presented in this article, named MQTT Logger.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MQTT Logger is a Node.js application which subscribes to MQTT topics of IoT sensors and stores the data that those published in an InfluxDB time-series database.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wardrobe and outfits management web app</title><link>https://articles.maximemoreillon.com/articles/0c1a7a47-c651-472d-a867-e1e2b040e997/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://articles.maximemoreillon.com/articles/0c1a7a47-c651-472d-a867-e1e2b040e997/</guid><description>&lt;p>Have you ever bought a piece of clothing only to come home and realize you already had a similar one in your wardrobe? This web application aims at solving this problem by allowing users to register their garments in a database.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Moreover, the application provides a way to register complete outfits and list the various garments that are parts it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://img.maximemoreillon.com/images/62b8fa733bbcba1c3e77be8c" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The application consists of a Node.js back-end which stores garment information in a MongoDB database. It also provides a REST API built using Express to exchange data with the application&amp;rsquo;s GUI. The latter is a Vue.js single page application featuring UI components from the Vuetify library.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>File POSTer</title><link>https://articles.maximemoreillon.com/articles/441/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://articles.maximemoreillon.com/articles/441/</guid><description>&lt;p>Many web applications rely on the upload of files from client to server via a POST request. The content-type of this request is generally multipart/form-data. When developing the server-side of such application, being able to quickly test the upload feature can greatly increase productivity. So, I designed this simple web application that can POST a file to any URL.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://img.maximemoreillon.com/images/61a2ddd34b39954ad9dae5c4" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The application is built using Vue.js with the Vuetify plugin and uses Axios to send the HTTP requests. Its source code is available on &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/moreillon_k8s_home/file-poster">GitLab&lt;/a>. The application can be deployed as a Docker container, for which the image is available on &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/moreillon/file-poster">Docker Hub&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MQTT control dashboard</title><link>https://articles.maximemoreillon.com/articles/555/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://articles.maximemoreillon.com/articles/555/</guid><description>&lt;p>With the cloud native multi-user MQTT platform deployed, I started designing IoT devices that I could distribute to end users. However, without a GUI, interacting with those devices would be difficult. Of course, one could install applications like MQTT dash or similar but this would require tedious configuration such as MQTT broker and topics. I wanted to give users a simpler UX so I made this simple control interface that automatically displays a users devices and allows those to be controlled.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>API tester</title><link>https://articles.maximemoreillon.com/articles/518/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://articles.maximemoreillon.com/articles/518/</guid><description>&lt;p>There are multiple tools available for API testing, Postman and Insomnia being probably the most popular. However, those are desktop applications that need to be installed. I wanted a solution that I can use in the browser so I made a simple web application to achieve basic API testing functions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This application can send GET, POST, DELETE, PUT and PATCH HPP requests and allows the user to add headers or a JSON body to the request.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
