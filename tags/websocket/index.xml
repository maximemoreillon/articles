Although it fulfills all my needs, I wanted to make my own system so as to get a fully customized smart home control panel and learn how to build such an application in the process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A simple way to build such an app would be to open the port corresponding to MQTT on my router and make an UI in JavaScript with an MQTT client-side library to communicate with the devices directly. However, for security reasons, I prefer to open only web-related ports to the public. Moreover, my MQTT traffic is currently unencrypted so it would not be wise to use it on a public network. Ideally, I would like to keep all MQTT communication internally with the MQTT port closed on my router, communicating via encrypted TCP traffic. For this purpose, I built a &lt;a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js&lt;/a> app that interacts with the outside world through HTTPS and then communicates with IoT devices internally.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
