      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a few projects involving digital twins. At its core, a digital twin is simply a digital representation, oftentimes in 3D, of a physical system. Such representation commonly provides information about the system as well as ways of interactions. On the physical system, this is can be accomplished with IoT devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having to build a dedicated application for each digital twin would be tedious so I designed a simple framework to make the process more convenient. The framework uses Three.js for the 3D representation of the system and MQTT to interact with its IoT devices, which led to the name MQTThree.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes manifests can seem quite daunting at first, but it is important to understand that their apparent complexity is simply a result of the large number of customization options. In the end, manifests are used to deploy resources that interact with each other, which, among others, lead to the correct operations of containerized applications. Consequently, resources specified in a manifest must be configured accordingly. This article aims at explaining how manifests are structured to do so.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MQTT Logger</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve used various IoT sensors which collect data that is then broadcast using MQTT. Those sensors generally broadcast individual measurements without saving any form of history locally. Consequently, if one would want to plot time-series graphs, the data would first need to be stored somewhere. This is the objective of the application presented in this article, named MQTT Logger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MQTT Logger is a Node.js application which subscribes to MQTT topics of IoT sensors and stores the data that those published in an InfluxDB time-series database.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>IoT EM4305 RFID Reader</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;RFID tags come in various forms and sizes, from standard plastic cards to chips that can be implanted in one&amp;rsquo;s hand. I got particularly interested in RFID rings, which can be purchased online for less than USD 20$. Those are based on EM4305 chips, which require a compatible reader. Thus, I designed an IoT EM4305 reader that can exchange data over MQTT with other devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hardware&#34;&gt;Hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reader is built around an ESP8266 Wifi microcontroller and an unnamed EM4305 reader module.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>IoT LED controller</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Smart lights are usually some of the first appliances to be added to a smart home. Although those can nowadays be purchased easily from various brands, I wanted to have my own hardware so as to integrate it better with other devices and software. Thus, I decided to an IoT LED controller that I can use in various projects where lighting has to be controlled via network protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://img.maximemoreillon.com/images/6240057135a52f5ea69e899b&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hardware&#34;&gt;Hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controller is built around an ESP8266 microcontroller (Wemos D1 mini) and N-Channel MOSFETS. The latter switch the 12V line of LED strips or COBs according to the microcontroller. Here, up to 4 channels of LEDs can be controlled by a single controller.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>IoT infrared controller</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although probably in the decline, infrared is a common way to remotely control household appliances such as air conditioners or TVs. Being able to turn on an AC unit without leaving the sofa is definitely comfortable, but sometimes it would be even better to be able to do it before even getting home. In order to control those various appliances, I designed a simple WiFi controlled IR emitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device consists of an ESP8266, an IR LED and IR receiver. The IR receiver is used to record IR signals from the original remote controller of the appliances. Those signals are stored in the ESP8266, which can then replay those using the IR LED.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>User management and authentication service using MongoDB</title>
      <link>https://articles.maximemoreillon.com/articles/495/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;More often than not, web applications require restrictions regarding who can access the content that they serve. This involves an user management and authentication system, which, if designed inappropriately, can lead to security concerns. However, the development of such system can be time consuming, especially if done repeatedly for multiple applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve this problem, this article presents a user management and authentication service, built around MongoDB, that can be easily plugged into an existing application with only minimal refactoring.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>DWC hydroponics system</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am not much of a cook so salads are usually one of my favorite options for a healthy meal. So, just like for everything else, I started wondering if I could make my own. However, I don&amp;rsquo;t have access to a garden so I started looking into solutions to grow vegetables indoors. I settled for hydroponics, which seemed to provide a good balance between yield and operational hassle. Specifically, I went for a Deep Water Culture type of hydroponic system as it is usually considered easy for beginners to setup.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>IoT lock</title>
      <link>https://articles.maximemoreillon.com/articles/237/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever left your apartment and couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember if you locked your front door or not? Sadly, if it is unlocked, there is not much you can do about it until you get back home. This system is an attempt to solve the problem. Simply put, it consists of attaching an actuator to the door&amp;rsquo;s original locking mechanism and control it via WiFi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose an MG996R as an actuator for its sufficient torque and angle range (180 deg). Most of the parts for this project have been 3D printed and designed in Fusion 360. The STL files are available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2462482&#34;&gt;Thingiverse&lt;/a&gt;. The servo&amp;rsquo;s shaft and the door&amp;rsquo;s locking mechanism are connected with parts designed specially so as to have a 90 degree play between them. This allows the lock to be operated normally without having the servo interfering.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
